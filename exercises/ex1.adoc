== Building a freestyle project
. Create a freestyle project in Jenkins
. Checkout the branch `ex1` from https://github.com/TheFutureStartsNow/jenkinsWorkshop.git[https://github.com/TheFutureStartsNow/jenkinsWorkshop.git]
. Use the gradle wrapper to run the gradle task `build`

== Testing a freestyle project
. Create a new freestyle project in Jenkins
. Checkout the branch `ex1` from https://github.com/TheFutureStartsNow/jenkinsWorkshop.git[https://github.com/TheFutureStartsNow/jenkinsWorkshop.git]
. Use the gradle wrapper to run the gradle task `test`
. Configure your freestyle project for testing to run after the build project was executed

== Archive artifacts
. Archive the jar file from build/libs/

== Notification
. Configure Jenkins to send an email to you if the build fails
. Test it by letting your build fail (i.e. change the archive jar to an invalid name)
